# Tronic247

Tronic247 is my blog. It's powered by SvelteKit and hosted on Vercel. The blog was originally powered by WordPress, but I migrated it to SvelteKit.

## Development

To start the development server, install the dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

Then start the development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on `localhost:5173`.
