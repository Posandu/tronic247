		Tronic247 was started in 2020 by <a href="https://posandu.com">Posandu</a>. Initially, it was
		just a blog where I shared my journey into web development. After that, as I improved my skills
		and knowledge, I realized that I could use my platform to help others who were just starting
		out. I began writing tutorials and guides on various topics, from basic HTML and CSS to more
		advanced topics like JavaScript and React.
