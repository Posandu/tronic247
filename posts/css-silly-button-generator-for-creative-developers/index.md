Buttons! Buttons! Buttons! You know them, right?

When you are visiting a webpage there are lots (At least one) of buttons. But most of them look boring and the same. Here's a Silly little button generator that might increase your creativity.

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-default-tab="result" data-slug-hash="MWoaGZv" data-user="Tronic247" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;"><span>Loading...</span></p>
<script async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

Each page load generates more than 500+ Styles for buttons. Some of them are nice while some are ugly. But, you can get inspiration from here on how to make a nice (or weird) button by looking at the generator. If you have any thoughts please share them below. :)
