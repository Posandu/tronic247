	<h1>About Tronic247</h1>

	<p>
		Tronic247 was started in 2020 by <a href="https://posandu.com">Posandu Mapa</a> (me lol)
	</p>

	<p>
		Initially, it was just a blog where I shared my journey into web development. However, as I grew
		in my skills and knowledge, I realized that I could use my platform to help others who were just
		starting out. I began writing tutorials and guides on various topics, from basic HTML and CSS to
		more advanced topics like JavaScript and React. So yeah, that's how Tronic247 was born.
