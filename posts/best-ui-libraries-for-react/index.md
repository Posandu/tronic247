If you don't like writing CSS, you can use a UI library that does all the hard work for you. But there are a lot of options. So In this article, I will compare the best React UI libraries and tell you which one is the best. Let's begin!

## Contents

## React-Bootstrap

Almost every dev knows bootstrap because of its large community. React-bootstrap is based on the Bootstrap CSS framework which is converted into react components.

### Example

So If I needed to add a button, I can import and use it like this.

```jsx
import Button from 'react-bootstrap/Button';

function Home() {
	return <Button variant="primary">Primary</Button>;
}
```

### Pros

- High community Support
- Lots of components
- Free templates
- Maintained

### Cons

- Design looks the same (You've seen that focus ring many times)

## MUI (Material UI)

If you like Material Design (Like me) this library is the best.

### Example

Adding a simple button would be like this:

```jsx
import Button from '@mui/material/Button';

function Home() {
	return <Button variant="text">Text button!</Button>;
}
```

### Pros

- Community is good
- Good UI components
- Provides utilities
- Good documentation
- Typescript support
- Highly Customizable

### Cons

- If you don't like material design, things may not be good

## Ant Design

Ant design is a minimalistic component library for creating Enterprise level products.

### Example

```jsx
import { Button } from 'antd';

const App = () => <Button>Default Button</Button>;
```

### Pros

- Minimalistic design
- Supports other JS frameworks
- Supports TypeScript

### Cons

- Most of the templates are in Chinese

## Chakra UI

Chakra UI is a mix of Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap. Which we can use to create beautiful sites.

### Example

```jsx
import { Button } from '@chakra-ui/react';

function Home() {
	return <Button colorScheme="blue">Button</Button>;
}
```

#### Pros

- Elegant UI

NextUI is a modern-looking UI library that looks very attractive. It is inspired by Material Design and other popular UI libraries.

### Example

```jsx
import { Button } from '@nextui-org/react';

function Home() {
	return <Button>Default</Button>;
}
```

### Pros

- Modern-looking UI

## Blueprint

Blueprint is a UI library for creating sketchy and simple websites.

### Example

import { Button } from '@blueprintjs/core';

function Home() {
	return <Button>Default</Button>;
}
```

### Pros
