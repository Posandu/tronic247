## How to edit a webpage using browser

Even though you don't have access to the source code of a webpage you can edit it using the browser. Here is how you can do it.

_Step 1_ - **Press F12 in your browser. The Inspector window will open.**

_Step 2_ - **Watch this video**

Step 3 - that's all!

This isn't permanent. If you refresh the page, the changes will be gone. But you can take a screenshot of the changes you made and have fun with your friends.
